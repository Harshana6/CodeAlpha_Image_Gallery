# Image Gallery

This is a simple and responsive image gallery built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to view images in a fullscreen popup view by clicking on them.

## 🌟 Features

- Responsive grid layout using CSS Grid
- Hover effects for interactive image presentation
- Fullscreen image view on click
- Close button to exit fullscreen mode
- Lightweight and fast

## 🛠️ How It Works

- All images are placed inside a grid.
- Clicking an image calls the `openFullImg()` JavaScript function, showing it in fullscreen.
- A close button (`X`) lets users close the fullscreen view.

## 🧾 How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Add your own images inside the `images/` folder (replace existing ones if needed).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 💡 Customization

- You can adjust the `grid-template-columns` in CSS to control how many images appear per row.
- Update the image hover styles for different effects.
- Add animation or transitions as desired.
